## üöÄ Quick Start (6-Hour Hackathon Setup)

### Terminal 1: Local Blockchain
```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn chain
```
This starts Anvil local blockchain on http://127.0.0.1:8545

### Terminal 2: Deploy Contract
```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn deploy
```
This deploys PropShare.sol and generates ABI

### Terminal 3: Start Frontend
```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn start
```
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

## üé¨ Demo Flow (2-Minute Video Script)

### 1. Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi! I'm presenting **PropShare** - bringing fractional real estate ownership to the blockchain. Let me show you how anyone can invest in property with just a few dollars."

### 2. Property Display (20 seconds)
- Show the hero section
- Highlight the property card with:
  - 5 ETH in rent balance
  - 50 out of 100 shares sold
  - 0.1 ETH per share price

### 3. Buy Shares (30 seconds)
- Click "Buy Shares" tab
- Enter amount (e.g., 10 shares)
- Show real-time cost calculation (1 ETH for 10 shares)
- Click "Buy Shares" button
- Show transaction confirmation
- Highlight updated "Your Shares" count

### 4. Deposit Rent (20 seconds)
- Switch to "Rent & Yield" tab
- Enter rent amount (e.g., 2 ETH)
- Click "Deposit Rent"
- Show updated rent balance

### 5. Withdraw Yield (25 seconds)
- Show "Claimable Yield" calculation
  - Formula: (Your Shares √ó Rent Balance) / Total Shares
  - Example: (10 √ó 5) / 100 = 0.5 ETH
- Click "Withdraw Yield"
- Show transaction and balance update

### 6. Governance (Optional - 10 seconds)
- Briefly show proposal creation
- Explain voting rights based on ownership

## üé® UI Highlights for Demo

### Professional Features to Emphasize:
1. **Gradient Hero** - Modern fintech aesthetic
2. **Two-Column Layout** - Property image + details
3. **Tabbed Interface** - Clean separation of actions
4. **Real-Time Calculations** - Instant feedback
5. **Loading States** - Professional UX (isMining indicators)
6. **Collapsible Sections** - Advanced features don't clutter UI

## üìä Key Metrics to Mention

- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized Solidity with minimal storage
- **Secure**: OpenZeppelin Ownable, tested extensively
- **Scalable**: Supports unlimited properties
- **Decentralized**: On-chain governance
- **Transparent**: All transactions public

## üîß Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Contract not deployed
```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx/packages/foundry
forge build
forge test
yarn deploy
```

### Issue: Frontend not connecting
- Check MetaMask is on Localhost 8545
- Ensure Anvil is running
- Refresh page and reconnect wallet

### Issue: Transaction fails
- Ensure you have test ETH (Anvil gives you 10,000 ETH on default accounts)
- Check you're using the correct property ID (should be 1 for first property)

## üìù Hackathon Pitch Points

### Problem:
- Real estate investing requires huge capital ($50K+ minimum)
- High barrier to entry for young investors
- Lack of liquidity in property investments
- No transparent rent distribution

### Solution - PropShare:
- **Fractional Ownership**: Buy shares from $10 (0.1 ETH)
- **Passive Income**: Automatic rent distribution based on ownership %
- **Liquidity**: Trade shares anytime on secondary markets
- **Transparency**: All transactions on blockchain
- **Governance**: Vote on property decisions

### Technical Innovation:
- Smart contract handles all logic (no centralized intermediary)
- Efficient yield calculation algorithm
- Built on Scaffold-ETH 2 (rapid development framework)
- Production-ready in 6 hours

### Market Opportunity:
- $280 trillion global real estate market
- Growing demand for fractional investments
- DeFi adoption increasing 40% YoY
