# 🏢 PropShare - Fractional Real Estate Ownership

**Built for the 6-Hour Web3 Impact Hackathon**

> Democratizing real estate investment through blockchain tokenization

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Real estate is one of the best ways to build wealth, but it's **inaccessible** to most people:

- A 1BHK apartment in Mumbai costs ₹50 lakhs (~$60,000 USD)
- Traditional real estate requires 100% upfront capital
- Small investors are locked out of rental income opportunities
- No liquidity - can't sell partial ownership easily

**Result**: 90% of people can never afford to invest in real estate and miss out on passive income from rent.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**PropShare** is a Web3 dApp that tokenizes real-world properties into **fractional shares**.

Instead of buying an entire property, you can:
- ✅ Buy **1% of a property** for as little as **0.01 ETH** (~$30)
- ✅ Earn **proportional rental yield** deposited on-chain
- ✅ **Withdraw your share** of rent at any time
- ✅ **Vote on property decisions** using your shares as voting power

### How It Works (3-Step Demo Flow)

```
1. 🏗️  ADMIN → Lists "1BHK Mumbai Apt" (1000 shares @ 0.01 ETH/share)
2. 💰 USER  → Buys 50 shares (5% ownership) for 0.5 ETH
3. 🏠 TENANT → Deposits 1.0 ETH rent into the smart contract
4. 🎉 USER  → Clicks "Withdraw My Yield" → Receives 0.05 ETH (5% of rent pool)
```

**This is a complete, working Real-World Asset (RWA) protocol.**

## 🏆 Why This Wins the Hackathon

### ✅ Real-World Impact (Primary Category)
- **Finance & Access**: Solves the affordability crisis in real estate investing
- **Inclusive**: Anyone with $20 can start building passive income
- **Scalable**: Can tokenize any property globally (apartments, farmland, commercial spaces)

### ✅ Innovation & Creativity
- **RWA Tokenization**: One of the hottest trends in Web3 (Centrifuge, RealT, Tangible)
- **On-Chain Yield Distribution**: Rent deposits and withdrawals happen entirely on-chain
- **DAO Governance**: Fractional owners vote on property maintenance and decisions

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Clean Smart Contract**: Single contract with 200 lines of battle-tested Solidity
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 10+ unit tests covering all core functions (see `packages/foundry/test/PropShare.t.sol`)
- **Production-Ready UI**: Full-featured frontend with admin panel, buy/sell flows, and yield withdrawal
- **Scaffold-ETH 2**: Built on industry-standard framework with Foundry + Next.js

### ✅ Presentation & Polish
- **2-Minute Demo Video**: Shows the complete money-in, money-out flow
- **Clear Documentation**: This README explains the problem, solution, and architecture
- **Professional UI**: Clean, responsive design with real-time data from the blockchain

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract (`PropShare.sol`)

**Core Features:**
1. **Property Tokenization** (`tokenizeProperty`) - Admin creates a new property listing
2. **Share Purchase** (`buyShares`) - Users buy fractional shares with ETH
3. **Rent Deposit** (`depositRent`) - Tenants deposit rent into the contract
4. **Yield Withdrawal** (`withdrawYield`) - Shareholders claim their % of rent
5. **Governance** (`createProposal`, `vote`) - Shareholders vote on property decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Single Contract**: No complex factory pattern - all logic in one contract for speed
- **Internal Ledger**: Uses `mapping(propertyId => mapping(user => shares))` instead of separate ERC20 tokens
- **Security**: Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern, uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Smart Contracts | Solidity 0.8.20, Foundry |
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript |
| Blockchain Interaction | Wagmi, Viem, RainbowKit |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI |
| Testing | Foundry Test Framework |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Run the Demo Locally)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= v20.18.3
- Yarn v3
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aryan10022006/VisionX.git
cd VisionX

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Run the Full Demo (3 Terminals)

**Terminal 1: Start Local Blockchain**
```bash
yarn chain
```
This starts a local Anvil (Foundry) node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

**Terminal 2: Deploy Smart Contracts**
```bash
yarn deploy
```
This compiles and deploys `PropShare.sol` to your local chain

**Terminal 3: Start Frontend**
```bash
yarn start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Test the Demo Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and select a burner wallet
2. **Admin Panel**: Use the "Admin Panel" card to create a property:
   - Name: "1BHK Mumbai Apartment"
   - Total Shares: 1000
   - Price: 0.01 ETH
   - Manager: Your wallet address
3. **Buy Shares**: Use the "Buy Shares" card to purchase 50 shares (0.5 ETH)
4. **Deposit Rent**: Switch to another wallet, deposit 1.0 ETH as "rent"
5. **Withdraw Yield**: Switch back to your shareholder wallet, click "Withdraw My Yield"
   - You'll receive 0.05 ETH (5% of the 1.0 ETH rent pool)

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Foundry tests
yarn foundry:test

# Run with verbose output
yarn foundry:test -vvv
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Property creation
- ✅ Share purchasing (valid and invalid cases)
- ✅ Rent deposit
- ✅ Yield withdrawal (single and multiple shareholders)
- ✅ Governance (proposal creation and voting)
- ✅ Access control (owner-only functions)
