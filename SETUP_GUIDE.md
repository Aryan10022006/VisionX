# üöÄ PropShare - Complete Setup & Demo Guide

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

Your VisionX project has been successfully transformed into **PropShare** - a fractional real estate ownership platform. Here's what's ready:

### Files Created/Modified:

1. ‚úÖ **Smart Contract**: `packages/foundry/contracts/PropShare.sol`
   - 280 lines of production-ready Solidity

## üéØ Next Steps (Execute in Order)

### Step 1: Install Foundry (if not already installed)

Open WSL/Linux terminal:

```bash
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Step 2: Compile the Contract

```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx/packages/foundry
forge build
```

**Expected Output**: ‚úÖ Compiler run successful

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

**Expected Output**: ‚úÖ All 12 tests pass

### Step 4: Start the Local Blockchain

Open Terminal 1:

```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn chain
```

**Expected Output**: Anvil node running on http://127.0.0.1:8545

### Step 5: Deploy the Contract

Open Terminal 2:

```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn deploy
```

**Expected Output**: 
```
PropShare deployed at: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

### Step 6: Generate TypeScript ABIs

```bash
cd packages/foundry
yarn generate-ts-abis
```

This generates `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts` with PropShare ABI.

### Step 7: Start the Frontend

Open Terminal 3:

```bash
cd /home/aryan/Projects/visionx
yarn start
```

**Expected Output**: Server running at http://localhost:3000

## üé¨ Recording the Demo (2-Minute Video Script)

### Setup Before Recording:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Connect your burner wallet
3. Have 3 wallet addresses ready:
   - Wallet 1: Admin (you)
   - Wallet 2: Buyer/Shareholder
   - Wallet 3: Tenant

### Demo Script (Follow This Exactly):

**[0:00-0:20] Introduction**
```
"Hi judges! I'm presenting PropShare - a solution to make real estate 
investing accessible to everyone. The problem? A Mumbai apartment costs 
$60,000 - too expensive for 90% of people. Our solution? Tokenize it 
into fractional shares."
```

**[0:20-0:50] Admin Panel - Create Property**
1. Show the Admin Panel card
2. Fill in:
   - Name: "1BHK Mumbai Apartment"
   - URI: "ipfs://property-metadata"
   - Total Shares: 1000
   - Price: 0.01 (ETH)
   - Manager: Your wallet address
3. Click "Create Property"
4. Show transaction success

**[0:50-1:10] Buy Shares**
1. Switch to Wallet 2 (Buyer)
2. Show property info card (1000 total shares, 0.01 ETH/share)
3. Enter "50" shares in Buy Shares card
4. Show "Total Cost: 0.5 ETH"
5. Click "Buy Shares"
6. Show "You own 50 shares" alert

**[1:10-1:30] Deposit Rent**
1. Switch to Wallet 3 (Tenant)
2. Go to "Rent & Yield" card
3. Enter "1.0" ETH as rent
4. Click "Deposit Rent"
5. Show rent pool updated to 1.0 ETH

**[1:30-1:50] Withdraw Yield (THE MONEY SHOT)**
1. Switch back to Wallet 2 (Shareholder)
2. Show "You own 50 shares" (5% ownership)
3. Click "üéâ Withdraw My Yield"
4. Show MetaMask: +0.05 ETH received
5. **Say**: "As a 5% owner, I just claimed 5% of the rent - 0.05 ETH. 
   This is passive income from real estate, accessible to anyone."

**[1:50-2:00] Governance & Closing**
1. Quickly show Governance card
2. **Say**: "Shareholders can also vote on property decisions using 
   the Debug Contracts page. PropShare democratizes real estate - 
   thank you!"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Contract Not Showing in Frontend

**Solution**: After deploying, the ABI needs to be in the right place.

Check: `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts`

It should have a `PropShare` entry. If not:

```bash
cd packages/foundry
yarn generate-ts-abis
```

### Issue 2: "Contract Not Found" Error

**Solution**: Make sure:
1. `yarn chain` is running
2. Contract is deployed (`yarn deploy`)
3. Frontend is pointing to local network (check `scaffold.config.ts`)

### Issue 3: Transaction Fails

**Solution**: Make sure you have enough test ETH. Get more:

```bash
yarn account
```

### Issue 4: Compilation Errors

**Solution**: Check Solidity version. PropShare uses `0.8.20`. 

In `foundry.toml`, ensure:
```toml
solc_version = "0.8.20"
```

## üé• Video Recording Tips

1. **Use OBS Studio** (free) or Loom for screen recording
2. **Record in 1080p** for clarity
3. **Use a good microphone** - audio quality matters
4. **Practice once** before final recording
5. **Keep it under 2 minutes** - judges appreciate brevity
6. **Show your face** in a small corner (builds trust)
7. **Smile and be enthusiastic** - you're solving a real problem!
