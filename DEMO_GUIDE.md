# 🎯 PROPSHARE - COMPLETE DEMO GUIDE

## 🚀 QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### STEP 0: Fund Demo Accounts (Check ETH Balance)
```bash
# From WSL or Linux terminal (recommended):
cd packages/foundry
yarn demo:accounts

# OR run directly from project root:
node packages/foundry/scripts-js/fundDemoAccounts.js
```
**This shows all test accounts with their balances and addresses** ✅
**Note**: If on Windows, use WSL terminal or Git Bash, not PowerShell

### STEP 1: Start Local Blockchain
```powershell
cd packages/foundry
yarn chain
```
**Keep this terminal running!** ✅
**Note**: This runs Anvil (Foundry's local blockchain), compatible with Hardhat accounts

### STEP 2: Deploy Contract (New Terminal)
```powershell
cd packages/foundry
yarn deploy
```
**Wait for "Deployment completed!" message** ✅

### STEP 3: Start Frontend (New Terminal)
```powershell
yarn start
```
**Open browser to http://localhost:3000** ✅

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"Cannot connect wallet"**
- Ensure MetaMask is installed
- Add Localhost 8545 network (see STEP 4 above)
- Import admin private key
- Refresh page

### **"Transaction failed"**

- Verify you're on correct account
- Check `yarn chain` terminal for errors
- Make sure contract is deployed

### **"Admin Panel not showing"**
- Must use Admin account: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
- Refresh page after connecting
- Check bottom-right AdminDebug panel
- Contract owner should match your wallet address

### **"Contract owner shows 'Loading...'"**
- Check if `yarn chain` is running
- Check if contract is deployed (`yarn deploy`)
- Verify correct network in MetaMask (Localhost 8545)
- Check contract address matches in `deployedContracts.ts`

### **"Property not appearing"**
- Wait for transaction confirmation (~2 seconds)
- Refresh page
